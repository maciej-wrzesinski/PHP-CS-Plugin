# Disclaimer
This project was written in 2015. I have to rewrite it in OOP and fix some other issues for it to work properly

# Technologies
HTML, CSS, javascript, MaterializeCSS, PHP, Smarty, LightOpenID, SourcePawn

# Description
This is the code of now closed www.cs-plugin.com that was selling CS:GO plugins. It contains an option to log in with Steam account, admin panel to modify plugin descriptions and add access to plugins for other users, feedback/opinion page, user panel for adding server IPs to database (so the page can observe whether its working) and nice looking layout
